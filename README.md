# Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Equipment using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the maintenance needs of industrial equipment. By analyzing historical data, the model can anticipate equipment failures, reduce unplanned downtime, and optimize maintenance schedules.

## Problem Statement

Machines are critical to all business nowadays, and we expect them to operate at peak level for long time. Normally, we can use corrective maintenance strategy to make the best use of machines. But we could end up costing even higher due to downtime and labor.

Preventive maintenance comes in to reduce unplanned failures while businesses try to address problem in advance. However, the costs could still be high. By using predictive maintenance, we can prevent those unexpected problems more efficiently. We can fix the machines just in time as we monitor and predict the status of them.

In this project, predictive maintenance is the main concept. There are two aspects to do the predictive maintenance in this project, supervised and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, predicting remaining useful life and failure prediction are the goals. While in unsupervised learning, detecting anomalies of the machine is the target. Python and its machine learning related libraries are the main tools in this project. The solution of this project could help industry to lower the chance of unexpected downtime and reduce costs.

## Aims and Objectives

The aim of this project is to propose machine learning solutions for predictive maintenance in responds to Industry 4.0. There are three tasks proposed:

* Anomaly detection: The model should be able to detect the anomalies within data.

* Remaining useful life prediction: The model should be able to predict the remaining useful life of a machine to help people be prepared for maintenance or replacement.

* Failure prediction: The model should be able to predict whether there will be a failure.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Implementing and comparing various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Guidelines for deploying the predictive maintenance model in a production environment.

            <li><strong>Discussion</strong>: Logistic Regression performed well, achieving a high accuracy. It’s suitable for binary classification tasks, but it may struggle with complex, non-linear patterns.</li>

            <li><strong>Discussion</strong>: The Decision Tree model showed perfect training accuracy, indicating potential overfitting. Despite this, the test accuracy remained high, suggesting it captured important patterns in the data.</li>

            <li><strong>Discussion</strong>: Random Forest outperformed other models in terms of accuracy. Its ensemble nature helps reduce overfitting while maintaining high performance, making it a robust choice for predictive maintenance.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Training Accuracy</strong>: 100%</li>
            <li><strong>Model Accuracy Score</strong>: 97.52%</li>
            <li><strong>Discussion</strong>: SVM achieved perfect training accuracy but slightly lower test accuracy. It’s effective in high-dimensional spaces but might be computationally expensive.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

<h3>Classification Report Summary (Weighted Average)</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Precision</strong>: 98%</li>
    <li><strong>Recall</strong>: 98%</li>
    <li><strong>F1-Score</strong>: 98%</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>The results demonstrate that machine learning can effectively predict maintenance needs, with Random Forest showing the highest overall performance. The high precision and recall indicate that the models are both accurate and reliable in identifying potential failures. However, it's important to consider factors like overfitting (as seen in the Decision Tree model) and computational complexity (in the case of SVM).</p>

<p>Future work could involve further tuning of hyperparameters, exploring more advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting, and integrating real-time data for continuous learning and prediction.</p>
