# Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Equipment using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the maintenance needs of industrial equipment. By analyzing historical data, the model can anticipate equipment failures, reduce unplanned downtime, and optimize maintenance schedules.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
- **Modeling**: Implementing and comparing various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Guidelines for deploying the predictive maintenance model in a production environment.
