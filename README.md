Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Equipment using Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict the maintenance needs of industrial equipment using machine learning techniques. By analyzing data from various sensors and historical maintenance records, the system can forecast potential failures and suggest maintenance schedules, thereby reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features from raw data.
Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms to train predictive models.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using various metrics.
Prediction: Forecasting maintenance needs and potential failures.
Visualization: Graphical representation of data and predictions for better understanding.
